This is my first blog for recording my studying experience, also the first website. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I will share my codes and experiences about my job and Android development learning. 

> I used to imagine that I would be a mechanical engineer one day after graduated from the college before 2019. However, I chose to be an Android developer -- a programmer eventually.

> There are many reasons why I made such a decision. The most important one I think is how my friends were treated in different machine factoryies: low salaries, noisy and dirty workshops and super-long working time... As far as I know, most of them have run away from this profession. Well, finally I deprecated all ideas that work as a mechanical engineer and started to stay with codes instead of machine parts.

> I won't regret that I chose to study Mechatronic Engineering in the summer of 2015, but I won't come back to study machines either. For me, it is meaningless to waste my life struggling with machine parts, oil and blue prints. If my work cannot bring me enough money and dignity, there is only one way: RUN!
