这是本人第一个用来记录学习历程的博客，也是第一个网站，千里之行始于足下。这个博客主要记录Android开发学习工作过程中的代码成果以及心得。

This is my first blog for recording my studying experience, also the first website. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. I will share my codes and experiences about my job and Android development learning.

I used to imagine that I would be a mechanical engineer one day after graduated from the college before 2019. However, I chose to be an Android developer, a programmer eventually.

There are many reasons why I made such a decision. Some of them are too sensitive to discuss with my friends in public, which may get me in trouble (actually I'm not joking). But some are common, such as the salary, the life style and so on, they can be talked about in public and I don't need to be so careful and fearful. Well, finally I deprecated all ideas that work as a mechanical engineer and started to stay with codes instead of machine parts.
